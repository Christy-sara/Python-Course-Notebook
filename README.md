# Python Course Notebook 🐍

This repository contains my learning notes and code examples from a Python basics course.  
I created this Jupyter Notebook as a structured reference to revise and practice Python concepts.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Python Basics
- Data Types & Variables
- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Exception Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation)

## 📂 Files
- `Python_course(1).ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with code + explanations
- `Python_course.html` → HTML version (for quick preview without Jupyter)
